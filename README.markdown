# 3. License, version & release date

License : GPL  
Version : v1.1  
Release Date : 2010-04-13

# 4. Description

By default, the Glype proxy script has few restrictions on what hosts / ports can be accessed through it. In addition, the proxy script normally displays all cURL-related error messages.  

Using these apparent weaknesses, GlypeAhead is able to perform portscans of targets with reasonable accuracy. Furthermore, the true location of the user is never revealed to the target since all scanning is performed by the remote Glype proxy script.

# 5. Requirements

PHP interpreter (with the cURL extension)
